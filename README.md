# Purple Pay Smart Contracts - Identity, Compliance and Transactions

## This repository consists of the smart contracts deployed for Identity and Transactions.

### Identity Namespace Contracts
1. Onchain Namespace allocation service to create a linkage between an identity wallet and a person or business through self-attestation.
2. Cross-chain data syncing and updation through Wormhole XDapp and communication protocol.
3. **Purple ID Issuer Platform** - We are in the process of creating the issuer platform with provision for creating identity wallet for the user and issue zkproof backed Verifiable Credentials on claims made (and later through Purple Pay and KYC/KYB vendor zk-backed VC issuance).
4. **Purple Pay Verifier Platform** - We are in the process of creating zk proof verification platform.

### Transactions Contracts
1. Factory contract to predict and deploy counterfactual addresses for receiving native and ERC20 tokens are also available.
2. We are in the process of moving to a decentralised transactions system to enable this flow.

### Open Source Purple Protocol
1. The SDK allows for developers to integrate a transactions layer into their Dapps.
2. The repository can be found at: [Purple Protocol Repository](https://github.com/Purple-Pay/purple-protocol)
